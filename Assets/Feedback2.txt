Beerus
Keys appearing too soon, even before the line

9 - Did you find the game engaging?
Yes because I'm a mechanics nerd and I wanted to figure out how it worked

10 - What are your opinions on the difficulty of the game?
Too hard no wait too easy actually
It was too hard to see the damage you were doing because the UI covered most of the scree nbecasuse you're focusing on the screen as you're doing it right and because of the lack of consquences for missing one you didn't get damaged at all
also the keys were very easy to hit actually to hit
I think for the first battle you start really slow
But there was only one battle
